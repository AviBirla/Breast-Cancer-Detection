# Breast-Cancer-Detection using Neural Network 
Data set used : ML Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset..... link : https://goo.gl/U2Uwz2

Creator:  Dr. William H. Wolberg, W. Nick Street, Olvi L. Mangasarian

► Libraries used :

○ Pandas

○ Numpy

○ Keras (models & layers)

○ Sklearn 

There are basically **two types of breast tumors** : **Benign :**(Benign tumors are those that stay in their primary location without invading other sites of the body.These are non-cancerous.) & **Malignant :** (Malignant tumors have cells that grow uncontrollably and spread locally and/or to distant sites. Malignant tumors are cancerous (ie, they invade other sites). They spread to distant sites via the bloodstream or the lymphatic system. This spread is called metastasis.)

Note: Above dataset it was found out that '0 ----> refers to Malignant' & '1 ----> refers to Benign'
